# Rain Prediction 🌧️🔮📈

## 🚀 Project Overview
This repository is dedicated to forecasting rainfall using a comprehensive dataset from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. The dataset encompasses a decade's worth of daily weather observations, including metrics like temperature, humidity, pressure, and wind speed. The goal is to predict the likelihood of rain tomorrow ('RainTomorrow') based on today's weather conditions.

## 📌 Key Features
- **Extensive Weather Dataset**: Leverages detailed weather data from 2008 to 2017, including various meteorological parameters.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Incorporates steps such as one-hot encoding for categorical variables, normalization, and data cleaning to prepare for model training.
- **Multiple Classification Models**: Applies various machine learning models like Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Trees, and SVM for rain prediction.
- **Model Evaluation**: Models are evaluated based on metrics like Accuracy, Jaccard Index, F1-Score, and Log Loss.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Focuses on predicting 'RainTomorrow' as a binary classification problem, utilizing historical weather data.

## 🛠️ Built With
- Python: For data manipulation and model building.
- Pandas & NumPy: For data handling and numerical computations.
- Scikit-Learn: For implementing various machine learning algorithms.
- Matplotlib: For visualizing data and results.

## 🎯 Application Scenarios
- **Weather Forecasting**: Useful for meteorologists and weather forecasting agencies.
- **Risk Management**: Assists in planning and decision-making processes for sectors dependent on weather conditions, like agriculture and logistics.

## 🔍 Inside the Code
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Includes initial exploration of the dataset to understand the features and their characteristics.
- **Feature Engineering**: Demonstrates the process of transforming and encoding weather data features for model compatibility.
- **Model Training and Prediction**: Details the training process for each model and predictions made for rain occurrence.
- **Performance Metrics Analysis**: Comparative analysis of different models based on various performance metrics.
